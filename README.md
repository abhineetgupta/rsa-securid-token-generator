# RSA SecurID Token Generator
An RSA SecurID 128-bit token generator application based on a docker image and [`python-securid`](https://github.com/andreax79/python-securid)

I could not find any apps for generating RSA tokens on Linux and the one for MacOS is quite outdated. I also did not like the idea of installing a closed-source app just to get an RSA token. So I created this completely containerized setup using open-source libraries which can be run with a single command to generate RSA SecurID tokens. It is tested on MacOS and is expected to work on any OS capable of installing docker.

## Setup instructions
1. Install docker and clone this repo.
2. Copy your `sdtid` file to the repo directory. 
3. Build the docker image - 
    ````
    docker build -t rsa_securid_token .
    ````
    `rsa_securid_token` is the image name, but any name can be given.
4. Once the image is built, a token can be generated by running - 
    ````
    docker run --rm rsa_securid_token
    ````
    If you have a pin, it can be provided by modifying the above command to the following, replacing the #'s with your 4-8 digits pin -
    ````
    docker run --rm rsa_securid_token --pin ####
    ````
